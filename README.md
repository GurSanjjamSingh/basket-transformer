## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project explores the application of transformer models to predict the next product in a grocery basket. It serves as an educational exercise to understand how transformer architectures can be adapted to real-world sequential data. The model is trained on a subset of the Dunnhumby dataset, containing 2 million baskets and 92,341 unique products.

## ðŸ§  Technical Details

### Data Preparation
The dataset consists of 2 million baskets, each containing a sequence of product IDs. The product IDs are tokenized into a vocabulary of 92,341 unique tokens. Each basket is converted into a sequence of product IDs, with a maximum length of 50 tokens.

### Model Architecture
The model is a 4-layer GPT-2 transformer with the following configuration:
- **Embedding Dimension**: 128
- **Number of Heads**: 4
- **Number of Layers**: 4
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.1
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Learning Rate**: 3e-4

The model is trained to predict the next product in the sequence, using cross-entropy loss on the last token of each sequence.

### Training Process
The model is trained for one epoch on a MacBook Pro M2, taking approximately 20 minutes. The training process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and split into training and validation sets.
2. **Model Initialization**: The GPT-2 model is initialized with the specified configuration.
3. **Training Loop**: The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and cross-entropy loss. The training loop includes forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, and weight update.
4. **Validation**: The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch.

### Results
After training, the model achieves a top-3 accuracy of approximately 9%, indicating reasonable learning. Here's a sample prediction:

bought      : ['SALAD DRESSING', 'CHEESE', 'EGGS']
next 3 items: ['TROPICAL FRUIT', 'COUPON', 'FLUID MILK']

## ðŸ“š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Dunnhumby - The Complete Journey** dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset contains household-level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It includes all of each householdâ€™s purchases, demographic information, and direct marketing contact history.

### Downloading the Dataset
1. **Create a Kaggle Account**: If you don't already have one, sign up at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
2. **Download the Dataset**: Navigate to the [Dunnhumby - The Complete Journey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/dunnhumby-the-complete-journey) dataset page and download the files.
3. **Place the Files**: Extract the downloaded files and place them in the `data/` directory of your project.
